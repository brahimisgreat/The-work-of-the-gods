                have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, 
                and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond
                to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.
